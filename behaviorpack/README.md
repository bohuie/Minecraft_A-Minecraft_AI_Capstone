# Mob Behavior

This was an attempt to change the way that the agent mob moved. 
Currently, the agent stays still unless coded to move in a specific direction. We tried to change this using the behavior packs implemented in MEE. Unfortunately, the Agent mob is programmed in such a way that behavior packs cannot change the mobs movement behavior to follow the owner.

Wolf mob behavior is what we were trying to replicate in the agent mob.
