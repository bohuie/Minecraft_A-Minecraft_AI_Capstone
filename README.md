We are building a Minecraft in-game Python editor that consists: 

    * command editing boxes: it allows user to write python commands that can listen for game events. 
    
    * buttons for each editing boxes: they are located at the right of python cell. **RUN** will run the commands in correspond cell; **REMOVE** will remove the corresponding cell. 
    * buttons for the whole interfaces: **ADD** will add a python cell in the interface, **RUN ALL** will run the commands in all cells at once. 
    
    * An output window: this window will collect and visualize the game data from the commands from python cells once the **RUN** or **RUN ALL** is clicked.
